# Tiny Blog Engine

The Tiny Blog Engine is a lightweight and highly customizable blog engine that empowers you to create and modify your own blogging platform with ease. 

It relies on [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) files for your posts and pages!

- **Lightweight**: The entire engine is only 230kb in size.
- **Dark & Light Mode**: Enjoy the convenience of built-in dark and light modes.
- **Customization**: Easily customize the colors, fonts, language to match your preferences.
- **Simple Deployment**: Requires only FTP access for deployment and posting (and a server that supports PHP, should be easy to find in 2023)
- **Comments & Interactions**: See [the documentation]([https://github.com/nithou/tiny-blog-engine/blob/main/README.md#comment--interactions](https://github.com/nithou/tiny-blog-engine/wiki/Comments-&-Reactions))
- **RSS2 Support**: Keeps your readers updated with RSS2 feed compatibility.
- **GDPR Compliant**: The engine respects your privacy by not relying on external dependencies.
- **Blocks AI crawlers**: By default the blog system forbids AI to use your content (for the [polite robots](https://darkvisitors.com/robots-txt-builder))
- **Support featured image for posts**: Add your featured image by using frontmatter 'img' variable!

All the informations are [available on the Wiki](https://github.com/nithou/tiny-blog-engine/wiki)!
